							Question-1



To change the umask value for any user permanently, we can go in the ~/.bashrc file and make changes in the umask value.

>>sudo gedit ~/.bashrc
Then change the current value of umask if present,or add the line.
>>umask
We'll get the changed value of umask which is permanently changed for that user.



							Question-2


The possible way to add an user without using adduser or useradd commands is:
Edit /etc/passwd with vipw and add a new line for the new account. Create the home directory of the user with mkdir.
We can fix peermissions with chmod.
>>cd /home/newusername
>>chmod go=
Set the password with passwd.



							Question-3


No, we can't change the umask value to 0888 as the maximum value for umask is 666.




							Question-4


In useradd command, Use the -u(--uid)option to create a user with a specific UID.
>>sudo useradd -u 1350 username.
We can also verify the user's id using id command:
>>id -u username
1350.



							Question-5


We can change the group ownership of given files through chgrp command.
>>chgrp [options] Group file..
